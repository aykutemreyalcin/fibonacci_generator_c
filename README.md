# Fibonacci Sequence Generator in C

## Overview
This C program generates the **Fibonacci sequence** up to a specified number of terms.

## How It Works
1. The user inputs the number of terms to generate.
2. The program starts with `0` and `1`.
3. Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
4. The sequence is printed up to the specified number of terms.

## Compilation & Usage

### Requirements
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)

### Compiling the Program
```sh
gcc fibonacci_generator.c -o fibonacci_generator
```

### Running the Program
```sh
./fibonacci_generator
```

### Expected Output
```
Enter the number of terms: 10
Fibonacci Series: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```
